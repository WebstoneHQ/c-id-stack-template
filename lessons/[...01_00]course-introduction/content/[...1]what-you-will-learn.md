# What you will learn

This is a hands-on course where you are expected to develop the full-stack application as you work your way through the course. All code is provided in the `lessons/**/source` directories, so feel free to check that out and copy / paste when necessary.

By the end of the course, you are going to be able to apply the learnings to your own project(s). This will not only saves you time, but also ensures you follow best practices and apply the most up-to-date techniques.

## Frontend

The web application in this course uses [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/), [SvelteKit](https://kit.svelte.dev/) and plain CSS.

If you have never used these frameworks, don't worry. We are going to cover the basics and progressively expand knowledge as and when it becomes necessary to learn new concepts. This approach to learn with context helps you better understand and remember what we discuss.

As an added, but important benefit, the web application is going to work even if JavaScript is disabled in the browser.

## API (Backend)

To develop the REST API, we are going to leverage [SvelteKit](https://kit.svelte.dev/). More specifically, we are going to develop [Endpoints](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/routing#endpoints) to expose the REST API.

As the integration between the API and the database (see next chapter), [Prisma](https://www.prisma.io/) is going to be our tool of choice. Again, just like with the frontend technologies, there is no need to have prior knowledge of Prisma â€” this course teaches everything you need to know.

## Database

Todo items are going to be persisted in a [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) database. Three important aspects are part of this course:

1. Work with the database in a developer environment (locally or in a cloud-based developer environment)
1. Deploy the database to a production environment
1. Apply data migrations as the data schema evolves

## Deployment

No project is complete until it is deployed and tested. In this course, we are going to deploy the web application, the API, and the database to a production-like environment. At the end, all that is left for you to do is purchase ~~yet another~~ a domain.

The course teaches you how to deploy the web application and API to the following providers:

* [Cloudflare Pages](https://developers.cloudflare.com/pages/)
* [Netlify](https://netlify.com/)
* [Vercel](https://vercel.com/)

You are also going to learn how to deploy the database to [Railway](https://railway.app/).
